		<h3>Cidade 1</h3>
		<p>I went to our house in the country with my Family. It’s a small house in a village in the mountains. We often go there at the weekends and we usually go there for a few weeks in the summer. It was really hot when we went this weekend. It was 35 degrees. I was surprised because it’s July. It’s usually cold.</p>
